          The Modern Slavery Registry was established as a resource for the public so that everyone can find out what steps companies are taking to eliminate slavery from their supply chains. It is estimated that between 12,000-17,000 companies will publish statements under the UK Modern Slavery Act. Finding these statements and adding them to the Registry is time consuming, so we welcome the many people who contact us to ask if they can help us by adding statements or to submit their own companyâ€™s statement to the Registry.

          You can use this form to do this. After you submit a statement to us, it will be reviewed and, if accepted, uploaded to the Registry. We take time to verify each statement carefully so that that information on the Registry is both useful and credible. We will also add the country of headquarters and sector for each statement. You will be notified by email when we have published the statement you have submitted.
