1,About us,About us,about_us,"<div>Section 54 of the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted"">UK Modern Slavery Act</a> requires commercial organisations that operate in the UK and have an annual turnover above Â£36m to produce a statement setting out the steps they are taking to address and prevent the risk of modern slavery in their operations and supply chains; it is also known as the Transparency in Supply Chains clause (TISC). A number of key stakeholders that were influential in securing the inclusion of the TISC clause also advocated for the Government to create a central registry that would host modern slavery statements. The Government has maintained its position that it will not establish a central registry, however, it does agree that it is a valuable resource.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Modern Slavery Registry provides this resource. The Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre and its partners agree that a central registry should meet a core set of criteria and be: independent, accountable to the public interest, robust, credible, free, open, accessible and sustainable in the long term. A resource that meets these criteria will enable stakeholders to analyse whether statements are in compliance with the legislation and analyse the quality of reporting.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>This Registry is guided and supported by a governance committee which includes: Freedom Fund, Humanity United, Freedom United, Anti-Slavery International, the Ethical Trading Initiative, CORE Coalition, UNICEF UK, Focus on Labour Exploitation (FLEX), Trades Union Congress, UN Principles for Responsible Investment, and Oxfam GB.&nbsp;<br><br>The following official supporters recommend the Modern Slavery Registry as the central registry for statements published pursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act:</div><ul><li>ICCR (Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility)</li><li>The Law Society</li><li>Business Social Compliance Initiative (a Foreign Trade Association initiative)</li></ul>",1,t,2018-07-13 14:27:45.382637,2019-01-22 16:15:38.528184,t,t

This is not intended to be, and should be approached, as a compliance exercise. Rather, companies are encouraged to take the necessary time and effort to consider their existing processes and practices related to modern slavery, as well as labour standards more generally.

7,Our Numbers Explained,Our Numbers Explained,numbers_explained,"<div>The Modern Slavery Registry is a free and public resource that increases transparency and accountability by tracking compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act. The UK Government estimates 9,000-11,000 companies are required to report under the&nbsp; Act. The Registry tracks how many companies comply with the reporting requirement. Each statement must meet three minimum requirements set forth in the Act. The Registry tracks compliance with these minimum requirements. Read more to learn about how we&nbsp; monitor compliance by companies.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How we count statements<br></strong><br></div><div>We track the number of statements we hold on the Registry by counting the single, unique statement provided by a company or group of companies. For example, if a modern slavery statement says it covers the actions of the named, reporting company and those of its subsidiaries or of additional, named companies, we count a single statement.<br><br></div><div><strong>How we count companies<br></strong><br></div><div>We track the numbers of companies who have reported under the Modern Slavery Act by counting the number of companies that have produced at least one statement. Companies increasingly have more than one statement because they are required to report annually. We link statements to the company that is named in the statement only. If more than one company is named in a statement- for example, subsidiaries - we link the statement to the parent company and do our best to indicate the names of the other companies the statement applies to. Many statements simply state that they apply to all subsidiaries or a group of companies.<br><br></div><div><strong>How we assess minimum requirements<br></strong><br></div><div>The UK Modern Slavery Act requires each statement published by a company to meet certain requirements:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Approval</strong> â The board of directors must approve the statement (if the company is a limited liability partnership, the members must approve the statement). Under our assessment:<br><br></div><ul><li>The statement must explicitly state the board (or members) has approved the statement; if the statement does not mention approval it is assessed as non-compliant.</li><li>Approval cannot be delegated by the board to an individual (such as a board member or director) or to a committee of the board.</li><li>Home Office guidance says best practice is to include the date of the meeting the board (members) approved the statement.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Signature</strong> - A director must sign the statement (if the company is a limited liability partnership, a designated LLP member must sign the statement). Under our assessment:<br><br></div><ul><li>The name and title of the appropriate person is sufficient; a signature is not required.</li><li>A signature or title alone is assessed as non-compliant.&nbsp;</li><li>A signature and title, without an individualâs name, is assessed as non-compliant.&nbsp;</li><li>Home Office guidance says best practice is that a member of the board of directors sign the statement.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Link</strong> - There must be a link to the statement on the homepage of the company website, or in a dropdown menu on the homepage. Under our assessment:&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li>The link must be in a visible location on the homepage or in an obvious drop-down menu on the homepage.&nbsp;</li><li>The link must clearly indicate it is a modern slavery statement; links called âcompliance statementâ, âsupply chainsâ, âpoliciesâ, for example, are assessed as non-compliant.&nbsp;</li><li>Home Office guidance suggests the link be called âModern Slavery Act Transparency Statementâ</li></ul><div><br></div>",5,t,2018-07-13 14:27:45.382637,2019-01-18 16:26:32.187772,t,t
