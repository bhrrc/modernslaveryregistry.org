  Section 54 of the
  <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted">UK Modern Slavery Act</a>
  requires commercial organisations
  that operate in the UK and have an annual turnover above Â£36m to produce a
  statement setting out the steps they are taking to address and prevent the
  risk of modern slavery in their operations and supply chains; it is also
  known as the Transparency in Supply Chains clause (TISC). A number of key
  stakeholders that were influential in securing the inclusion of the TISC
  clause also advocated for the Government to create a central registry that
  would host modern slavery statements. The Government has maintained its
  position that it will not establish a central registry, however, it does
  agree that such a resource would be valuable.
</p>
<p>
  The Modern Slavery Registry, operated and maintained by the Business &amp;
  Human Rights Resource Centre, seeks to fulfil the role left by Government.
  The Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre and its partners agree that
  a central registry should meet a core set of criteria. It should be:
  independent, accountable to the public interest, robust, credible, free,
  open, accessible and sustainable in the long term. A resource that meets
  these criteria will enable stakeholders to analyse whether statements are
  in compliance with the legislation and analyse the quality of reporting.
</p>
<p>
  This Registry is guided and supported by a governance committee which
  includes: Freedom Fund, Humanity United, Freedom United, Anti-Slavery
  International, the Ethical Trading Initiative, CORE Coalition, UNICEF UK,
  Focus on Labour Exploitation, and Oxfam GB.

  Section 54 of the
  <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted">UK Modern Slavery Act</a>
  requires companies to produce a
  statement that describes what actions they are taking to address modern
  slavery in their operations and supply chains. This is not intended to be,
  and should be approached, as a compliance exercise. Rather, companies are
  encouraged to take the necessary time and effort to consider their existing
  processes and practices related to modern slavery, as well as labour
  standards more generally. An effective, informative and substantive
  statement will address and report on modern slavery in the context of a
  broader human rights due diligence context. The guidance provided here will
  assist companies understand stakeholders expectations of modern slavery
  statements under Section 54.
