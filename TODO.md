  - [ ] Link
  - [ ] Board
  - [ ] All 3
  - [ ] 2 of them

### Admin / Security
- [ ] Only display hidden field when logged in

## UX
- [ ] Iframe statements - deal with "Refused to display '<statement URL>' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'."
  - SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18327314/how-to-allow-http-content-within-an-iframe-on-a-https-site
  - Could try to change all http URLs to https during import/save
  - Use a proxy (ugh)
- [ ] Company statements - most recent on top, and highlighted
- [ ] Show validation errors in forms
- [ ] Hint that hidden fields are hidden from public
- [ ] Display company HQ
  - [ ] Country
  - [ ] Flag
- [ ] Consolidate some of these pages:
  - https://msa-registry.herokuapp.com/companies/2/statements/2
  - https://msa-registry.herokuapp.com/companies/2
  - https://msa-registry.herokuapp.com/companies/2/statements/new√ü
- [ ] Remove new company button/form

# Map
- [x] Use Geonames to get HQ country geo location
- [ ] Get better geo location for countries
  - Currently we're interpolating north/south and west/east, which
    works OK for most countries, but not all. Norway is one example,
    its "centre" ends up in Sweden.
  - Maybe use geo loc for capital

## Performance
- Database
  - Query for map (country + companies) makes a query per country. Optimize
  - [x] Add DB indices
- [ ] Pay for more dynos
- [ ] Speed up rendering
  - Cache (CloudFlare)
  - CSS: `table-layout: fixed;`

## Data
- [ ] Remove Linked From

### Integrity
- [ ] Enforce HQ country
- [ ] Validate statement URL is URL, and exists, possibly store with https

### Import
- [x] Import countries from Geonames
- [x] Import sectors
- [x] Import companies
- [x] Import statements
- [x] Record who signed
- [ ] Get correct "seen" dates from public registry

## Styling

- [ ] Map domain name
- [ ] https / let's encrypt
